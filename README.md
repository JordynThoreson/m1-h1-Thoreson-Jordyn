## About Me ##
I currently work as a Communications Specialist at UFHR Communications & Worklife. You probably receive my weekly *UF at Work* emails! I also run the faculty and staff social media accounts and the GatorPerks discount program. Outside of work, I enjoy going to the beach and the springs, or you can find me curled up with a good book on rainy days. I also have two cats, Winona and Mavis, and a roommate with a third, Suki.
## Past Coding Experience ##
Outside of Scratch, which I used as a child, I have very limited coding experience. I work with WordPress sites and SalesForce Marketing Cloud for work and have taught myself some very basic HTML to make my life easier, but that's about it!
## Career Goals ##
1. I want to work primarily with start-up businesses and non-profits.
    1. Freelance or in-house
    2. Initial branding & logo creation
    3. Web presence optimization
2. Once I have enough experience and expertise, I would love to take on the position of a Creative Director.
    1. In-house or agency
    2. Overseeing art direction, copywriting and overall brand execution
